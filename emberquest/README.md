## 🎮 What Is It?

EmberQuest turns your real-life habits into an RPG adventure. Every workout, study session, glass of water, and resisted urge becomes XP that levels up your pixel-art hero.

- 🧬 **Morphing hero** — muscles grow from workouts, fade from inactivity, belly grows from junk food
- ⚔️ **Weekly boss raids** — Procrastination Slime, Couch Golem, Doomscroll Wraith
- 📊 **7-day trend analytics** — green/yellow/red performance charts
- 🚭 **Bad Habit Quitter** — clean streaks with urge-resist XP
- 🕸️ **Radar chart** — balance across Strength, Stamina, Focus, Knowledge, Recovery, Fuel, Reflection
- 💡 **Lighting switch** — corner toggle turns all glow effects on/off; 7 colour themes plus a custom colour picker
- 🔊 **8-bit sound effects** — synthesized live via Web Audio API
- 💾 **JSON export/import** — backup your progress anytime
